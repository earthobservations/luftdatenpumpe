# About luftdaten.info

## Introduction
[luftdaten.info] is a community project from Stuttgart, Germany. Due to its geographical location 
and microclimatic situation, Stuttgart has high particulate matter (PM) levels on a regular basis.
People at [OK Lab Stuttgart], a project supported by [Code for Germany] of [Open Knowledge Foundation] fame 
constructed cost-effective particulate sensors easily to rebuild by everyone to provide an alternative to 
monitoring systems from governmental agencies.

The sensor readings from [DIY fine dust sensors] are acquired by the backend application [feinstaub-api], 
displayed on the [luftdaten.info map] and archived at the [luftdaten.info archive].

## Growth
The project is a classical civic-tech with a crowdsourcing approach, it is growing steadily and is 
getting more and more even international attention. 

- [2016] luftdaten.info is in the process of installing low cost, crowdfunded sensor nodes across many 
cities in Germany to measure PM levels.

- [2018] In the meanwhile, there are more than 6,000 sensor nodes online. Mainly located around
Europe, they start to spread across the whole world.

## Quotes
> There is certainly growing awareness of the issue among Stuttgart residents. 
  Luftdaten is in the process of installing low cost, crowdfunded sensors across 
  the city to measure PM levels [...].

> “I wanted to build cost-effective sensors, given the less than reliable government 
  data and coverage regarding air pollution,” explains Jan Lutz, a social entrepreneur 
  who runs Luftdaten’s website.

> “But I think in five years Stuttgart will be like Detroit or something, because there 
  is simply no innovation” he adds. “The automobile industry continues to produce more cars, 
  which is basically two tonnes of steel transporting a 70kg human. It’s an overkill, 
  and not sustainable in the long run.”
