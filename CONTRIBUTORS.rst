Creating this program would not have been possible without the help of the
amazing people listed above.

Many more people have been involved creating the foundation infrastructure
and the software components this program is leveraging, it is built upon
Grafana, InfluxDB, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Python, and all the associated
modules around them.

Standing on the shoulders of giants. Thank you so much, you know who you are.
